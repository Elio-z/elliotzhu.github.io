								<h3>Exploring the Causal Relationship between Walkability and Affective Walking Experience: Evidence from 7 Major Tertiary Education Campuses in China</h3>

								<h6>Abstract</h6>
								<p> This study investigates the causal relationship between campus walkability and the emotional walking experiences of students, with a focus on their mental well-being. Using data from 697 participants across seven Chinese tertiary education campuses, the study employs a counterfactual analysis to estimate the impact of campus walkability on students' walking experiences. The analysis reveals that students living in campuses with improved walkability are 9.75% more likely to have positive walking experiences compared to those without walkability renovations... </p>

								<h3>ausal inference for observational longitudinal studies using deep survival models.</h3>

								<h6>Abstract</h6>
								<p> This paper proposed a time-variant causal survival (TCS) model to estimate potential hazard functions under time-varying binary treatments using an ensemble of recurrent subnetworks. The method used ensemble training to capture the uncertainty of network estimation from varying random seeds, and a dedicated propensity score layer is used to adjust the selection bias presented in the data. TCS provides estimations of conditional treatment effect (CATE) in absolute terms using the difference between survival curves under different treatment conditions. In simulations studies, TCS model showed good causal effect estimation performance across scenarios of varying sample dimensions, event rate, confounding, and overlapping... </p>

								<h6>Abstract</h6>
								<p> Epidemic models are being used by governments to inform public health strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries.  ... </p>

								<h3>Targeted estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect in observational survival analysis.</h3>

								<h6>Abstract</h6>
								<p>...The aim of clinical effectiveness research using repositories of electronic health records is to identify what health interventions ‘work best’ in real-world settings. Since there are several reasons why the net benefit of intervention may differ across patients, current comparative effectiveness literature focuses on investigating heterogeneous treatment effect and predicting whether an individual might benefit from an intervention ... </p>
